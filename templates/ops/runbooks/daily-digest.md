# Runbook: Daily Digest

> Morning summary of overnight activity, deployments, and open work. Run at the start of each day or after a long patrol gap.

## When to Run

- Start of each working day
- After a long gap (>6 hours without a patrol cycle)
- On request from the {{OPERATOR_ROLE}}

## What to Report

### 1. Site Health Snapshot
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "status:%{http_code} time:%{time_total}s" {{SITE_URL}}
```

### 2. Overnight Issues
```bash
gh issue list --repo {{GH_ORG}}/{{REPO_NAME}} --state all --json number,title,state,createdAt,closedAt --limit 20
```

### 3. PR Activity
```bash
# Open PRs
gh pr list --repo {{GH_ORG}}/{{REPO_NAME}} --state open

# Recently merged PRs
gh pr list --repo {{GH_ORG}}/{{REPO_NAME}} --state merged --limit 5
```

### 4. Recent Deploys
```bash
git log {{MAIN_BRANCH}} --since="24 hours ago" --oneline
```

### 5. Open Work Items
- `ops/slices/REGISTRY.md` — any claimed but incomplete slices?
- `ops/projects/ACTIVE.md` — current project status
- Open PRs waiting for review
