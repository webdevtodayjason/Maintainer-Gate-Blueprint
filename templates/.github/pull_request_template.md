## Root Cause / Regression History

For bug fixes or regressions, explain why this happened, not just what changed.
Otherwise write `N/A`.

- Root cause:
- Missing detection / guardrail:
- Prior context:
- Why this regressed now:
- If unknown, what was ruled out:

## Regression Test Plan

- Coverage level that should have caught this:
  - [ ] Unit test
  - [ ] Integration / seam test
  - [ ] End-to-end test
  - [ ] Existing coverage already sufficient
- Target test or file:
- Scenario the test should lock in:
- Why this is the smallest reliable guardrail:
- If no new test was added, why not:

## Validation

- [ ] `{{CI_BUILD_COMMAND}}`
- [ ] `{{CI_CHECK_COMMAND}}`
- [ ] `{{CI_TEST_COMMAND}}`
- [ ] `{{CI_PROTOCOL_COMMAND}}`
- [ ] `{{CI_DASHBOARD_COMMAND}}`

Exact commands run and result:

{{CI_BUILD_COMMAND}}
{{CI_CHECK_COMMAND}}
{{CI_TEST_COMMAND}}
{{CI_DASHBOARD_COMMAND}}
```

## Human Verification

- Edge cases checked:
- What you did NOT verify:

## Risk and Recovery
